This learning adventure, in a way, was pretty intense and practically set our minds back to figuring out how Docker
teams up with Kafka in an interconnected setup. At the beginning, well, we kind of hit a roadblock with Kafka's producer
and consumer scripts since it turned out that the essential commands were nowhere to be found inside the container.
So that really pushed us to take a deeper look into what was happening within its file system to understand why those commands
just werenâ€™t there. You know, it got slightly tricky because this particular container used Alpine Linux instead of our usual
stuff like apt-get for package management. Therefore, we ended up depending on things like kafkacat which meant getting accustomed
to an unfamiliar setting and toolkit as quickly as possible.

Unfortunately, the amount of issues kept piling up and whenever we solved one issue, 2 more arose. I think we learned a lot about how to 
get apache working with Kafka and the rest of our containers in theory, but we struggled to implement it in practice.
